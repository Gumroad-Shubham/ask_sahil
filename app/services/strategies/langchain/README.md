Typically for this kind of task (QnA on existing knowledge repository), people use [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) in Python. 
This is a TODO / research task. See how it works. And if the algo/performance is superior to that of our strategy, see if we can implement it in Ruby. 
Alternatively, we can have the ruby code call python internally / have a python server which is called by our rails application.

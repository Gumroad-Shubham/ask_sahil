This strategy uses the exact (slightly modified to run independently without 
changing logic) code written by Sahil at https://github.com/slavingia/askmybook
See these:

2. https://github.com/slavingia/askmybook/blob/main/hello/views.py

TODOs:
1. CSV files were generated earlier and the code to generate them is stale and won't work currently. Update that.
2. Move CSV files to a inner directory, separate from code.
